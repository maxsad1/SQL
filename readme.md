### SQL Collection 

This repository is the collection of wonderful scripts by Oracle Gurus who have publically shared their scripts for learning. I compiled this to categories and credit goes to original authors of the script. 

For my scripts use oracle_scripts repository.

TBD -- I will expand the documentation for each script soon.
